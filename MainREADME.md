# Digital Speech Signal Processing Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects demonstrating various methods and techniques in the field of digital speech signal processing. Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic or method.

## Projects

1. [Welch's Method for Spectrogram, Periodogram, and Power Spectral Density (PSD) Calculation](./README_Welch_RealSignal.md)
    - This project demonstrates how to compute and plot the spectrogram, periodogram, and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a signal using Welch's method. The signal used in this project is a 440 Hz sine wave, which is a periodic signal.
